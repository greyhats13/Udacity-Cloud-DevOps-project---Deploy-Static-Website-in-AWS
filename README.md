# Udacity-project---Deploy-Static-Website-in-AWS
This is the cloud project from udacity leveraging Amazon S3 and Cloud Front for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS. First, I created a S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket. Next step, I configured the bucket for website hosting and secured it using IAM policies. Then, I speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™ content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, I accessed my website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
